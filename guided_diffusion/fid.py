#To implement a test for your diffusion model using the FID (Fréchet Inception Distance) score, you'll need to follow these general steps:

#    Generate Fake Samples:
#        Use your diffusion model to generate a set of fake samples (images, data, etc.) that you want to evaluate.

#    Prepare a Reference Dataset:
#        Collect or prepare a reference dataset of real samples that is representative of the data you want to model.

#    Preprocess Data:
#        Ensure that both your generated samples and the reference dataset are preprocessed in the same way. This might include resizing, normalization, or other relevant transformations.

#    Compute FID Score:
#        Use a pre-trained Inception-v3 model to extract features from both the generated and real datasets.
#        Compute the mean and covariance of these features for both datasets.
#        Use the mean and covariance to calculate the Fréchet Inception Distance.

#Here's a simplified example using the popular pytorch-fid library:

# Step 1: Generate fake samples using your diffusion model
fake_samples = generate_fake_samples()  # Implement this function based on your diffusion model

# Step 2: Prepare a reference dataset
# For example, you might have a DataLoader for your real dataset
real_dataset = DataLoader(your_real_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)

# Step 3: Preprocess data
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((299, 299)),  # Inception-v3 input size
    transforms.ToTensor(),
])

fake_samples = transform(fake_samples)
real_samples = [transform(batch) for batch in real_dataset]

# Step 4: Compute FID Score
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

fid_value = fid_score.calculate_fid_given_paths([fake_samples], [real_samples], device=device)
print(f"FID Score: {fid_value}")

#Note:

#    Replace generate_fake_samples() with your own function that generates samples using your diffusion model.
#    Ensure the datasets are preprocessed consistently.
#    Install the pytorch-fid library if you haven't already (pip install pytorch-fid).
